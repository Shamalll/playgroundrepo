# playgroundrepo
This is a playground where I just practice random things that make no sense to see if it works or not. 
    
   A sandbox that make no sense like API, or practice React.js like JSX, Loops, stats, and props or I might even
   
   go out of my realm of expertise and mess with Python or C(# or ++) because I've been interested in Game Development. 
   
   Either way, it's just a bunch of expereiments and nonsense code.
